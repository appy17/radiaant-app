          <p>
            Pranic healing is a part of alternative therapies, a method of
            energy healing. It was founded and promoted by Grand Master Choa Kok
            Sui. Prana is called ‘chi’ in China and ‘ki’ in Japan. The word
            pranic was originated from a Sanskrit word ‘Prana’ which means life
          </p>

          <p>
            Life force (Prana) simply means energy. All matters in the universe
            are made up of energy. It is not just about our physical body we are
            talking about here. Even, our thoughts and feelings are also energy
            waves which actually can be measured through proper
          </p>

          <p>
            Even up and downs in your relationships, the amount of money you
            earn are all basically just energy patterns. And the most
            interesting part is that all humans have this natural ability to
            feel this energy and to modify it. But only a few of them can
            generally realize that and some of them use their knowledge to help
            others.This is the paragraph on the left side.

          <p className="paragraph">
            n the 1980s, Filipino Master Choa Kok Sui conducted an exhaustive
            investigation into the power of energy for healing. He compiled and
            synthesized the knowledge of the Chinese, Indian Rishis (Hindi:
            'wise, saint'), Taoists and Tibetan monks and designed a practical
            system of scientifically documented healing called Pranic.
          </p>

          <p className="paragraph">
            This method of healing is based on the management of Prana and has
            been used for many years by oriental medicine with great Success
          </p>

          <p className="paragraph">
            And, therefore, Master Choa - through the Institute for Inner
            Studies, established in 1987 by him and The World Pranic Healing
            Foundation, created in 1990 - decided to teach this practice to
            spread it and make it available to everyone
          </p>

          <p className="paragraph">
            And, although it does not replace the medicine practiced in Western
            hospitals, it does complement its results consistently and has
            achieved healing in cases of cancer, arthritis, migraines, chronic
            stress and gastritis, among other diseases
          </p>

          <p className="paragraph">
            To date, the Foundation, in addition to its branch office in India,
            has been able to help spread Pranic Healing in Indonesia, Bhutan,
            Nepal, Malaysia, Hongkong, Thailand, Srilanka, Singapore, UAE,

            Kenya, Rwanda, Zambia, Tanzania, Mauritius and South Africa. Pranic
