                  FOUNDER OF MODERN PANIC HEALING
                </h3>

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-base">
                  Grand Master Choa Kok Sui, through his research and
                  experiments, conceptualized a comprehensive method that helps
                  in cleansing and energizing the energy system which pervades
                  the physical body, thus accelerating the rate at which the
                  body can heal itself. Through his teachings and practical
                  application of Pranic Healing, he demonstrated that energy is
                  an important factor in healing not only the physical being but
                  also the psyche. Most of GMCKS' spiritual experiments were
                  conducted along with his clairvoyant friends, Mang Nenet and
                  Mang Mike who observed and monitored the procedure and the
                  results of these experiments. Based on his experiments, Master
                  Choa Kok Sui conceptualized, formulated and developed Modern
                  Pranic Healing, as we know it today. His concepts, principles,
                  techniques and methodologies were the result of the synthesis
                  of deep intellectual understanding and wise intuition.

                  THE SCIENTIST
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-base">
                  At a very young age became interested in yoga, psychic
                  phenomena, mysticism, Chinese Chi Kung and other esoteric
                  studies. During his development as Grand Master he received a
                  degree in engineering and became a successful businessman. He
                  has spent more than eighteen years researching and studying
                  esoteric sciences that have resulted in the Pranic Healing
                  System teachings. <br></br>
                  Initially trained as a chemical engineer, his scientific
                  orientation enabled him to carefully systematize the
                  techniques of Pranic Healing. Along with committed
                  participants he spent several years experimenting to determine
                  the effectiveness and the mechanism of the healing techniques
                  commonly known and used by healers and students of esoteric
                  sciences. He can often be heard saying in answer to a question
                  about a technique or modality “Let’s experiment”. In every
                  course he teaches there are always experiential segments to
                  ensure that the students are clear about the technique and
                  demonstrates through experiments.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-base">
                  Master Choa Kok Sui has taught thousands worldwide how to
                  effectively heal themselves and others. The courses he has
                  designed are extremely simple and yet very effective. Because
                  of this simplicity Pranic Healing can be utilized by students
                  as solely a healing modality or can be a way of life. Many of
                  his students continue into advanced courses as they realize
                  that his techniques are accessible, easily understood and
                  extremely powerful and have affected tremendous positive
                  changes in their lives.<br></br>
                  The word ‘Master’ follows from the Chinese convention denoting
